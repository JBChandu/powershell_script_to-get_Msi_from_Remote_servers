# powershell_script_to-get_products_installed_in_Remote_servers

- Create servers.txt without fail where script picks all servers.
- Create userid.txt ,password.txt files without fail and add the paths correctly into script
- what is achieved is we can get products installed in each remote server as "remoteservername".csv file in a folder.
- From that we can import data into excel for each server in each sheet "data->get data from file/folder" 
- after selecting one csv file to import u will see a powerQuery window on that click "Transform and Load"
- Do some desired powerQueries operations(like.remove duplicate records,remove some column,etc.,) on the data and import it and enable automatic data refresh. 
- And you can do lot more on top of it by creating multiple excels and combining them for reports and etc.,
